bearded-octo-archer
===================

A repository for [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/) playbook roles.
Be mindful of and consider yourself warned these were composed by
someone learning ansible.

The name was auto-generated by github and it sounded awesome so I 
kept it. What I would love to see is a cool logo/drawing of the 
unbeatable Bearded Octo Archer.
